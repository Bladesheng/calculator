make it possible to change operator when chaining operations

bug - if you press number, then operator, then enter
- the number from buffer 1 (current number) should be copied into buffer 2
- same thing when chaining operations

nice css

round long buffer to prevent overflow (in css)
- fix entering too long numbers (prevent entering too long numbers)

(squared button, other functions)
